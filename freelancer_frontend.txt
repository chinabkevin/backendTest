Freelancer Registration Flow (Frontend)
1. Flow Overview (from freelancer.txt):
Landing Page → “Join as a Lawyer”
Registration Form:
Name, Email, Phone, Experience
Upload credentials (ID, Bar Certificate, etc.)
Select Areas of Legal Expertise
Agree to Platform NDA & Guidelines
Submit → Backend /api/users/sync (if new) → /api/freelancers/register
Await Verification

2. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
A. UI/UX
Page: /auth/signup or /freelancer/register
Form Fields:
Name, Email, Phone, Experience (years)
Areas of Legal Expertise (multi-select)
Upload: ID, Bar Certificate, Additional Docs
Checkbox: Agree to NDA & Guidelines
Submit Button
B. Logic
User signs up or logs in via Supabase.
Sync user to backend (/api/users/sync).
Submit freelancer registration to /api/freelancers/register with all form data and the local user id.
Show “awaiting verification” message after successful registration.
3. Example: React/Next.js Component Structure
A. Registration Form Component
/frontend/src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx (or /freelancer/register/page.tsx)
B. Key Steps in Code
Use Supabase Auth for login/signup.
On first login, call /api/users/sync to get local user id.
On form submit, upload files (if needed), then call /api/freelancers/register.
4. Example: Registration Form Skeleton (React/Next.js, TypeScript)
Would you like:
A full working registration page (with file upload, multi-select, NDA checkbox, etc.)?
Or a minimal working example to get started?
