Lawyer Dashboard UX
Lawyer Dashboard UX Design ‚Äî Key Features & Flow
1. Notification Center for New Assignments
Purpose:
Keep lawyers immediately informed about new case assignments to ensure timely responses.

Design Considerations:

Real-time alerts: A bell or notification icon with a red badge count indicating new assignments.

Brief preview: On click, display a dropdown list of new cases with key info:

Case Title

Client Name

Submission date/time

Urgency/priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low)

Quick actions: Buttons to Accept or Decline directly from the notification panel for fast interaction without leaving the page.

Notification history: Link to ‚ÄúAll Notifications‚Äù page for reviewing older assignments and updates.

2. Intuitive Accept/Decline Workflow with Deadlines & Priority Markers
Purpose:
Enable lawyers to manage incoming cases efficiently, prioritize work, and commit to cases clearly.

Design Elements:

Case List Overview:
A table or card layout showing all assigned cases filtered by status ‚Äî Pending Acceptance, Accepted, Declined.

Pending Cases Section:

Prominent accept/decline buttons for each pending case.

Deadline display: Show time remaining to accept (e.g., ‚ÄúAccept within 48 hrs‚Äù).

Priority tags: Color-coded markers (red for High, orange for Medium, green for Low) visible next to case titles.

Confirmation Modal:
When a lawyer clicks Accept or Decline, a modal pops up:

Confirm action with case summary.

Optionally add notes or reasons for decline.

Reminder of deadlines and next steps after acceptance.

Status Feedback:
After action, immediate visual update in the dashboard:

Accepted cases move to ‚ÄúActive Cases‚Äù section.

Declined cases disappear from the pending list and notify admin/client accordingly.

3. Easy Access to Client Documents & Annotation Tools
Purpose:
Streamline lawyer‚Äôs ability to review documents and add annotations directly, improving collaboration and turnaround times.

Key UX Features:

Document Access Panel:

For each case, list all uploaded client documents with file type icons (PDF, DOCX, etc.).

Click to open documents in an integrated viewer or download.

Integrated Annotation Tool:

Inline viewer with tools for highlighting, commenting, and drawing on documents.

Sidebar for lawyer‚Äôs annotation notes linked to document sections.

Auto-save annotations to annotated_document_url and annotation_notes fields in the backend.

Version Control:

Track document versions with timestamps.

Allow lawyer to upload updated annotated versions.

Task & Comment Threads:

Allow lawyers to create task checklists or threaded comments visible to clients/admin (depending on permissions).
